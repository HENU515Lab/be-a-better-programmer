#   lab2: Linux Installation

##  Objective

To install a distribution of Linux as a second bootable operating system on a Personal Computer, and to acquire a basic level of understanding of and ability to use several features of the Linux operating system.

##  What is Linux

Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.

In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, OS X, or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and types of software you are accustomed to using on other operating systems, such as word processing applications, have Linux equivalents. In many cases, the software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. If you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.

But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to.

Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components.


##  Assignment

1. install a distribution of Linux **as a second bootable** operating system (**not visual machine**).
2. I am not “tech support” for whatever combination of distribution/machine you choose to use. There are plenty of online resources available to you (Ubuntu recommended).
3. If you choose to install your distribution directly on your home PC or laptop, be sure to **backup your information**. While it’s rare, bad things can happen when you start resizing/creating new partitions on your hard drive.
4. After installing Linux operating system, install google chrome explorer and make sure you can search.

## Resources

Just Google “install <your favorite distribution here>”, for example, “install Ubuntu”. You can install Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora or whatever floats your boat. Also, post any questions you have !

##  Deliverables

In Lab, before Sunday, December 30, I need to see you startup your new distribution or, if you installed it on your home PC, I need to see a screenshot.
